| **SCD Type 1** | **Overwrite** | Updates old values with new ones; no history preserved | Customer address update, always latest |
| **SCD Type 2** | **Historical Tracking** | Preserves history; creates a new row for each change with start/end dates or version number | Employee department changes, retain all historical records |
